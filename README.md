# Pathfinding_Visualization
A simple Python script to visualize the breadth-first-search algorithm for pathfinding. <br>
For this script to run, only pygame is needed.

# Functionalities
- Switching between a slow mode where each iteration of the algorithm is shown and a fast mode where the path is calculated in advance and then written to the screen
- Adding obstacles using the right mouse button
- Setting a goal using the left mouse button
- Allowing/Disallowing Diagonal Movement
